      "Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking about Punxsutawney Phil and how many years earlier he would need to have been alive to make a Groundhog Day prediction in the same state as the US capitol.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to break down the question. The key points are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Punxsutawney Phil's canonical lifespan or existence.\n",
      "2. The requirement for him to have made a prediction in the same state as the US capitol.\n",
      "3. Determining how many years earlier he needs to have been alive to meet that condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the US capitol is in Washington, D.C., which is a federal district, not a state. But the question mentions \"the same state as the US capitol.\" Since Washington, D.C. isn't a state, maybe the user is referring to the state that the capitol is located in geographically. However, Washington, D.C. is in the District of Columbia, which is separate from any state. The nearest states are Virginia and Maryland, but the capitol itself isn't in a state. Hmm, maybe the user made a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps they meant the state where the current Groundhog Day event is held. Punxsutawney Phil is from Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. So the Groundhog Day event is in Pennsylvania. The US capitol is in D.C., so they are in different states. The question is asking when Phil's predictions started, so that if he had started earlier, he could have been making predictions in the same state as the capitol. Wait, but that doesn't align. Maybe the user is confused. Alternatively, perhaps they think the capitol is in a state, so maybe they meant the state where the capitol is located, but since it's not, maybe the question is based on a misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the user is asking if the Groundhog Day event was held in D.C., how much earlier Phil would need to have existed to have predictions there. But the event is in Pennsylvania. So perhaps the question is asking when the first Groundhog Day prediction was made, and how many years earlier Phil would need to have been around to have started in the same state as the capitol (D.C.), but since that's not possible, maybe the user wants to know when the event started in Pennsylvania, and how much earlier Phil would need to have existed to have predictions in D.C. instead. This is getting a bit tangled. Let me rephrase the original question again: \"How many years earlier would Punxsutawney Phil have to be canonically alive to have made a Groundhog Day prediction in the same state as the US capitol?\" So the key is that the state where the US capitol is located is D.C., but since that's not a state, maybe the user intended a different state. Alternatively, perhaps they meant the state where the capitol building is located geographically, which is Maryland, since part of D.C. is in Maryland's original territory. But legally, D.C. is separate. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake and meant the state where the current Groundhog Day is held (Pennsylvania) versus the capitol's state, but that's not a state. Alternatively, maybe they confused the capitol with another state's capital city. Alternatively, perhaps the question is hypothetical: if the Groundhog Day prediction had to be made in the same state as the US capitol (D.C.), how much earlier would Phil need to have existed? Since the event is in Pennsylvania, which is a different state, the answer would involve the start year of the event in Pennsylvania and the desired state (D.C.), but since D.C. isn't a state, maybe the user wants to know when the first Groundhog Day was held, and how much earlier Phil would need to have been alive to have started in D.C. instead. Alternatively, maybe the user is asking when the first Groundhog Day prediction was made, and how many years earlier Phil would need to have existed to have predictions in the same state as the capitol (D.C.), but since that's impossible, perhaps the question is based on a misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the state where the capitol is located, but since it's not a state, perhaps they meant the state that the capitol is in geographically, like Maryland or Virginia, but that's not accurate. Alternatively, maybe the user is confused and thinks the capitol is in a state, so the answer would involve finding when the Groundhog Day started in Pennsylvania and then calculating how many years earlier Phil would need to have been alive to have started in that state (Pennsylvania) compared to when the capitol was established. Wait, the US capitol building was established in 1793, but the Groundhog Day tradition in Punxsutawney started in 1886 or 1887. So if the user is asking how much earlier Phil would need to have been alive to have started predictions in the same state as the capitol (D.C.) before the capitol was built, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the question is simpler: the Groundhog Day event is in Pennsylvania. The US capitol is in D.C. So the user wants to know how many years earlier Phil would have to have been alive to have made a prediction in D.C. (if that were possible), so the difference between the start year of the event in Pennsylvania and the desired start year in D.C. But since the event is in PA, maybe the question is asking when the first Groundhog Day was, and how much earlier Phil would need to have existed to have started in D.C. instead. Alternatively, perhaps the user is asking if the Groundhog Day event had been held in D.C. instead of PA, how much earlier would Phil need to have been alive to have predictions there. But since the event is in PA, maybe the answer is the difference between the current year and the start year, but I'm getting confused. Let me try to structure the breakdown as per the user's instructions. The user wants the breakdown, not the answer. So the steps would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Determine the current year or the year up to which Punxsutawney Phil's predictions are considered canonical.\n",
      "2. Identify the state where the US capitol is located. (Note: The US capitol is in Washington, D.C., which is not a state.)\n",
      "3. Since the capitol isn't in a state, clarify if the user intended a different state or if there's a misunderstanding. However, following the query as given, proceed with the assumption that the user might have meant the state where the capitol is geographically located (e.g., Maryland or Virginia), but this is unclear.\n",
      "4. Find the earliest year Punxsutawney Phil made a Groundhog Day prediction in Pennsylvania (the actual state where the event is held).\n",
      "5. Calculate the difference between the earliest possible year Phil could have started predictions in the intended state (as per the query's requirement) and the current canonical start year to determine how many years earlier he would need to have been alive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps the user is asking: Since the Groundhog Day event is in Pennsylvania, and the US capitol is in D.C., which is not a state, the question might be based on a mistake. But the user might have intended to refer to the state where the capitol is located, so maybe they meant the District of Columbia as a state, which it's not. Alternatively, maybe they confused the capitol with another state's capital. Alternatively, perhaps the question is hypothetical, assuming that the Groundhog Day event was held in the same state as the US capitol (D.C.), so how much earlier would Phil need to have existed to have started there. Since the event is in PA, the answer would involve the start year of the event (1887) and the desired start year in D.C., but since that's not possible, maybe the user wants the difference between the event's start year and the establishment of the capitol. The capitol was established in 1793, so 1887 - 1793 = 94 years later. So Phil would need to have been alive 94 years earlier to start in 1793. But this is speculative. The breakdown should just parse the question without solving it. So the steps would be:\n",

      "Breakdown:\n",
      "1. Identify the current year or the latest year Punxsutawney Phil's predictions are considered canonical.\n",
      "2. Determine the state where the US capitol is located (Washington, D.C., which is not a state).\n",
      "3. Since the capitol is not in a state, clarify the intended state (possibly the user made an error, but proceed as per the query).\n",
      "4. Find the earliest year Punxsutawney Phil made a Groundhog Day prediction in Pennsylvania (the actual state where the event occurs).\n",
      "5. Calculate how many years earlier Phil would need to have been alive to have started making predictions in the same state as the US capitol (assuming the user intended a different state or there's a misunderstanding).\n",

Always provide a \\'Thought:\\' sequence, and a \\'Code:\\\\n```py\\' sequence ending with \\'```<end_code>\\' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \\'answer = wiki({\\'query\\': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})\\', but use the arguments directly as in \\'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")\\'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: [\\'collections\\', \\'datetime\\', \\'itertools\\', \\'math\\', \\'queue\\', \\'random\\', \\'re\\', \\'stat\\', \\'statistics\\', \\'time\\', \\'unicodedata\\']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don\\'t give up! You\\'re in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.'}]}, {'role': <MessageRole.USER: 'user'>, 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': \"New task:\\nActual query:\\nHow many years earlier would Punxsutawney Phil have to be canonically alive to have made a Groundhog Day prediction in the same state as the US capitol?\\n\\nHere is a suggestion on how the question could be broken down:\\n  \\n1.

Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \\'answer = wiki({\\'query\\': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})\\', but use the arguments directly as in \\'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")\\'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: [\\'collections\\', \\'datetime\\', \\'itertools\\', \\'math\\', \\'queue\\', \\'random\\', \\'re\\', \\'stat\\', \\'statistics\\', \\'time\\', \\'unicodedata\\']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don\\'t give up! You\\'re in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin!

The code sequence must end with \\'<end_code>\\' sequence.\\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use \\'print()\\' to save whatever important information you will then need.\\nThese print outputs will then appear in the \\'Observation:\\' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\\n\\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\\n---\\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\\n\\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\\nCode:\\n```py\\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\\nprint(answer)\\n```<end_code>\\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\\n\\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\\nCode:\\n```py\\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\\nfinal_answer(image)\\n```<end_code>\\n\\n---\\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\\n\\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\\nCode:\\n```py\\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\\nfinal_answer(result)\\n```<end_code>\\n\\n---\\nTask:\\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\\n- web_search: \\n    Performs web search based on your query (think a Google search) then returns the final answer that is processed by an llm.\\n    Takes inputs: {\\'query\\': {\\'type\\': \\'string\\', \\'description\\': \\'The search query to perform\\'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n    Takes inputs: {\\'answer\\': {\\'type\\': \\'any\\', \\'description\\': \\'The final answer to the problem\\'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: any\\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a \\'Thought:\\' sequence, and a \\'Code:\\\\n```py\\' sequence ending with \\'```<end_code>\\' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \\'answer = wiki({\\'query\\': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})\\', but use the arguments directly as in \\'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")\\'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: [\\'collections\\', \\'datetime\\', \\'itertools\\', \\'math\\', \\'queue\\', \\'random\\', \\'re\\', \\'stat\\', \\'statistics\\', \\'time\\', \\'unicodedata\\']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don\\'t give up! You\\'re in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin!
